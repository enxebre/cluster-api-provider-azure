                by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster
                autoscaler with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler
                compares machines to nodes to find out machines at provider which
                could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as
                a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required
                by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view of the list of machines.
                Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then a
                comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked
                for delete. This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by
                higher level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing with
                cluster-api as generic provider.
